<!--A local comedy radio show needs you to develop an audio soundboard for them. The soundboard will display a grid of Alan Partridge samples. When a sample is clicked the associated audio file will play. The audio samples for this exercise are located in Exercises/Audio Sampler. Your sampler must:

* Include all of the samples in the Audio Sampler directory;
* Display all samples on a single non-scrolling page;
* Make use of correct semantic markup;
* Display the correct sample name;
* Change the colour of the background, and text, when the user hovers over a sample;
* Include index.html, style.css and index.js files;
* Include creative styling for your background, sample buttons, fonts and hover effects;

Use the below example as a reference:
