<!--The radio show loved the sampler you made for them before, but they'd like to give a more advanced system a go. In a new directory,
    build on top of your previous sampler and include the following new ideas:

* The show would like to include a text to speech feature. This feature allows presenters to type any text they like into a `<textarea>`
element and have it converted to audio which then plays immediately. This new feature should be displayed in a seperate column next to
the audio samples (see image below for reference);

* The show would like to include more audio samples. However, they only want sampler to display nine samples at a time.
Create a system whereby the team can use "left" and "right" arrows to scroll through an extended bank of samples.
The team is open to your creative ideas as to what audio is included on these new pages. When the first page is displayed,
the "left arrow" should be hidden, and when the last page is displayed the "right" arrow should be hidden (prevents users from
scrolling to blank sample pages or encountering errors);

* The team would like the length of the sample in seconds to be dynamically displayed underneath the sample title.

Use the below example as a reference:
