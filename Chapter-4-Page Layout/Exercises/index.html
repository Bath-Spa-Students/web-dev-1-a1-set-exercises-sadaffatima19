<!--Using the website reference image below, code this website (focussing on proper structural markup). Your work doesn't need to be
    exact in attempting to recreate the padding, margins etc., but you do need to recreate the layout of the page exactly, using the
    structural elements you've been taught. You must include:

- Header;
- Navigation menu;
- The main "Welcome" content;
- "Line Up" content, including two square images underneath the text;
- Footer;
- index.html and style.css files.

These tags might come in useful: `<header>` `<nav>` `<main>` `<section>` `<article>` `<div>` `<aside>` `<footer>`

- Logo and Heading font: "Tahoma", 700 (Apple users, you may have a tad bit more work to do here)
- Body font: "Arial", 400
- Header: #17072b
- Sidebar: #172d67
- Footer: #8c15e9
- Text: #000000 and #FFFFFF

- Welcome text: Digi Fest is a celebration of digital and technology in the city of Cardiff. This year, we are celebrating 
‘collaboration’, so come and find out about the latest collaborations that are happening in this historic and innovative city.
They promise an educational and inspirational packed programme for all.
