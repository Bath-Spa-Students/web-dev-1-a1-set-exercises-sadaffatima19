<!--### Three images :ballot_box_with_check:

In a new index.html file display three images (that you would be legally allowed to use for a commercial project) and do the following: 

* Select a theme which ties all three images together.
* Give each image an appropriate alt attribute.
* Give each image appropriate width and height attributes (retaining its original aspect ratio). 
* Give each image an appropriate title attribute.
* Use CSS filters to change the appearance of all three of your images.
* Ensure each image is under 300kb.
* Underneath each image, provide information on its copyright license. -->
