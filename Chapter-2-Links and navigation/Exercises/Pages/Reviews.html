    <li>"As a young kid I loved the original Lost In Space series, which went from b/w to colour very quickly because of its popularity
    with millions of kids all over the world. For me, the change of Dr Smith from the male cast of the original concept to a female
    casting in this series - even changed after the 2010 movie remake - made the atmosphere on Jupiter One that little more mysterious I believe.
    With the launch of the first series and how the viewing numbers racked up to unbelievable levels didn't surprise me at all,
    except for the obvious long break that eventually brought season 2. Timing is everything in anything to do with TV or Movies.
    Imagine going to a restaurant and ordering your meal you've been tasting mentally all day - only for it to come along three hours
    later and the want, taste and need for it has gone! That's showbiz. Lost In Space was a lot of fun to watch, even for my kids 
    who aren't really sci-fi fans, but managed to get on board every episode and see that there was this imaginative world where hope
    and love for family brought everything together. If you haven't seen the series, then I would recommend that you give it a go at least.
    Yes, it's not for everyone, but giving something a chance is better than ditching something that may or may not have picked up your entire day with entertainment." <b>~Marcus De Storm</b></li>

    <li>"The show is great whether you like sci-fi or not the story is great and keeps you entertaining throughout.
        The first season is simple a colony of humans go for a trip to the nearest star to our sun alpha centauri (yes i did some research) and a alien AI Robot attack happens and they get stranded on a solar system unknown where they take refuge on a planet little and about there way to find a way back to civilization. 
        The second season start is disappointing as it made no sense at all and had too many plot points although many of them are solved by the end but still many were unresolved but further the season 2 has lot going for it particularly the all women they had an important role this season. 
        The CGI is on point and the worlds look gorgeous and the life that they have shown.They did a great job on the robot it looked stunning.The visuals of most of the planets and other nature shots will stun you as they are beautifully made.
        The first season ended on a cliff hanger and so does the second and  every episode i guess ended on a note that wants you to come back for more.This is why it becomes a good show as it constantly makes you come back for more. <b>~Ch Habib</b></li>

    <li>"I love sci-fi flics but not into space based series, shows, or movies. **BUT… this show is simply Amazing!!** It has almost
        every category you can want in any show. There's the sci-if, comedy, drama, violence, gore,(if there is such a thing as 
        “CLASSY GORE” this is it Hahaa;)~  Some shows have characters tht you can “see” some of your own self in from 
        decisions—emotions—& attitude. You really get to see the characters and story grow into such a wonderful show!
        Even if you don't like space,alien,spaceships&etc you should give this show a shot bc it's not yr “normal” space show it has
        so much more to offer. (Also If you like space shows you will guarantee love this show) Lost in space is great for family's, 
        children, teens, show bingers like me lol, or even as a date option is good too! LIS will pull heart strings, make you 
        angry(in a good way lol) question why this or tht happens, make you laugh, maybe cry, but it will definitely make you fall in
        love with all characters in this show for many different reasons it's amazing!;)))~ ) I would recommend this to friends and
        family most definitely!!;)):)) <b>~Alisha Parker</b></li>
