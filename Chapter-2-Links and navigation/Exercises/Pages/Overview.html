    On October 16, 1997, the United States is gearing up to colonize space. The Jupiter 2, a futuristic saucer-shaped spacecraft, 
    stands on its launchpad undergoing final preparations. Its mission is to take a single family on a five-and-a-half year journey to 
    an Earth-like planet orbiting the star Alpha Centauri.
    The Robinson family consists of Professor John Robinson (Guy Williams), his wife Maureen (June Lockhart), and their three children: 
    Judy (Marta Kristen); Penny (Angela Cartwright); and Will (Bill Mumy). The family is accompanied by U.S.
    Space Corps Major Donald West (Mark Goddard). The Robinsons and Major West are to be cryogenically frozen for the voyage, and they 
    are set to be unfrozen when the spacecraft approaches its destination.
    Dr. Zachary Smith (Jonathan Harris), Alpha Control's doctor, is revealed to be a saboteur working on behalf of an unnamed nation, 
    with which he communicated under the code name Aeolis-14-Umbra. After disposing of a guard who catches him aboard the spacecraft, 
    Smith reprograms the Jupiter 2's B-9 environmental control robot (Bob May, voiced by Dick Tufeld) to destroy critical systems on 
    the spaceship eight hours after launch. Smith becomes trapped aboard at launch, however, and his extra weight throws the Jupiter 2 
    off course, causing it to encounter asteroids. This, plus the robot's rampage, causes the ship to prematurely engage its hyperdrive,
    and the expedition becomes hopelessly lost in the infinite depths of outer space. Smith's selfish actions and laziness frequently 
    endanger the expedition, but his role assumes less sinister overtones in later parts of the series.

    <h2>Season 1</h2>
    The astronaut family of Dr. John Robinson, accompanied by a pilot and a robot, set out in the year 1997 from an overpopulated 
    Earth in the spaceship Jupiter 2 to travel to a planet circling the star Alpha Centauri. The Jupiter 2 mission is sabotaged by 
    Dr. Zachary Smith - an agent for an unnamed foreign government - who slips aboard the spaceship and reprograms the robot to 
    destroy the ship and crew. However, Smith is trapped aboard, and his extra weight alters the craft's flight path and places it 
    directly in the path of a massive meteor storm. Smith manages to save himself by prematurely reviving the crew from suspended 
    animation. The ship survives, but the damage caused by Smith's earlier sabotage of the robot leaves the crew lost in space. 
    The Jupiter 2 crash-lands on an alien world, later identified by Will as Priplanus, where they spend the rest of the season and 
    survive a host of adventures. Smith remains with the crew and acts as a source of comedic cowardice and villainy, exploiting the
     eternally forgiving nature of Professor Robinson.

    <h2>Season 2</h2>
     At the start of the second season (from this point on filmed in color), the repaired Jupiter 2 launches into space once more, to 
     escape the destruction of Priplanus following a series of cataclysmic earthquakes.
     The Robinsons crash-land on a strange new world, to become planet-bound again for another season.

    <h2>Season 2</h2>
     In the third season, a format change was introduced. In this season, the Jupiter 2 travels freely in space in seven episodes,
     visiting a planet but leaving at the end, or encountering an adventure in space. They visit new worlds in several episodes,
     with both crash and controlled landings, as the family attempts to either return to Earth or else at least reach their original
    destination in the Alpha Centauri system. A newly introduced "Space Pod" provides a means of transportation between the ship
    and passing planets, allowing for various escapades. This season had a different set of opening credits and a new theme tune,
    which had been composed by John Williams as part of the show's new direction.
