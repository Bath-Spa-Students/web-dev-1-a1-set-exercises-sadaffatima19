        Lost in Space is an American science fiction television series, created and produced by Irwin Allen, which originally aired between 1965 and 1968 on CBS.
        The series was inspired by the 1812 novel The Swiss Family Robinson. The series follows the adventures of the Robinsons, a pioneering family of space colonists who struggle to survive in the depths of space.
        The show ran for 83 episodes over three seasons. The first season comprised 29 episodes that ran 1 hour apiece, filmed in black and white. In seasons 2 and 3, the episodes were 54 minutes long and shot in color.

        On October 16, 1997, the United States is gearing up to colonize space. The Jupiter 2, a futuristic saucer-shaped spacecraft, 
        stands on its launchpad undergoing final preparations. Its mission is to take a single family on a five-and-a-half year journey to 
        an Earth-like planet orbiting the star Alpha Centauri.
        The Robinson family consists of Professor John Robinson (Guy Williams), his wife Maureen (June Lockhart), and their three children: 
        Judy (Marta Kristen); Penny (Angela Cartwright); and Will (Bill Mumy). The family is accompanied by U.S.
        Space Corps Major Donald West (Mark Goddard). The Robinsons and Major West are to be cryogenically frozen for the voyage, and they 
        are set to be unfrozen when the spacecraft approaches its destination.
        Dr. Zachary Smith (Jonathan Harris), Alpha Control's doctor, is revealed to be a saboteur working on behalf of an unnamed nation, 
        with which he communicated under the code name Aeolis-14-Umbra. After disposing of a guard who catches him aboard the spacecraft, 
        Smith reprograms the Jupiter 2's B-9 environmental control robot (Bob May, voiced by Dick Tufeld) to destroy critical systems on 
        the spaceship eight hours after launch. Smith becomes trapped aboard at launch, however, and his extra weight throws the Jupiter 2 
        off course, causing it to encounter asteroids. This, plus the robot's rampage, causes the ship to prematurely engage its hyperdrive,
        and the expedition becomes hopelessly lost in the infinite depths of outer space. Smith's selfish actions and laziness frequently 
        endanger the expedition, but his role assumes less sinister overtones in later parts of the series.

        <h2>Season 1</h2>
        The astronaut family of Dr. John Robinson, accompanied by a pilot and a robot, set out in the year 1997 from an overpopulated 
        Earth in the spaceship Jupiter 2 to travel to a planet circling the star Alpha Centauri. The Jupiter 2 mission is sabotaged by 
        Dr. Zachary Smith - an agent for an unnamed foreign government - who slips aboard the spaceship and reprograms the robot to 
        destroy the ship and crew. However, Smith is trapped aboard, and his extra weight alters the craft's flight path and places it 
        directly in the path of a massive meteor storm. Smith manages to save himself by prematurely reviving the crew from suspended 
        animation. The ship survives, but the damage caused by Smith's earlier sabotage of the robot leaves the crew lost in space. 
        The Jupiter 2 crash-lands on an alien world, later identified by Will as Priplanus, where they spend the rest of the season and 
        survive a host of adventures. Smith remains with the crew and acts as a source of comedic cowardice and villainy, exploiting the
         eternally forgiving nature of Professor Robinson.

        <h2>Season 2</h2>
         At the start of the second season (from this point on filmed in color), the repaired Jupiter 2 launches into space once more, to 
         escape the destruction of Priplanus following a series of cataclysmic earthquakes.
         The Robinsons crash-land on a strange new world, to become planet-bound again for another season.

        <h2>Season 2</h2>
         In the third season, a format change was introduced. In this season, the Jupiter 2 travels freely in space in seven episodes,
         visiting a planet but leaving at the end, or encountering an adventure in space. They visit new worlds in several episodes,
         with both crash and controlled landings, as the family attempts to either return to Earth or else at least reach their original
        destination in the Alpha Centauri system. A newly introduced "Space Pod" provides a means of transportation between the ship
        and passing planets, allowing for various escapades. This season had a different set of opening credits and a new theme tune,
        which had been composed by John Williams as part of the show's new direction.

        <li>"As a young kid I loved the original Lost In Space series, which went from b/w to colour very quickly because of its popularity
        with millions of kids all over the world. For me, the change of Dr Smith from the male cast of the original concept to a female
        casting in this series - even changed after the 2010 movie remake - made the atmosphere on Jupiter One that little more mysterious I believe.
        With the launch of the first series and how the viewing numbers racked up to unbelievable levels didn't surprise me at all,
        except for the obvious long break that eventually brought season 2. Timing is everything in anything to do with TV or Movies.
        Imagine going to a restaurant and ordering your meal you've been tasting mentally all day - only for it to come along three hours
        later and the want, taste and need for it has gone! That's showbiz. Lost In Space was a lot of fun to watch, even for my kids 
        who aren't really sci-fi fans, but managed to get on board every episode and see that there was this imaginative world where hope
        and love for family brought everything together. If you haven't seen the series, then I would recommend that you give it a go at least.
        Yes, it's not for everyone, but giving something a chance is better than ditching something that may or may not have picked up your entire day with entertainment." <b>~Marcus De Storm</b></li>

        <li>"The show is great whether you like sci-fi or not the story is great and keeps you entertaining throughout.
            The first season is simple a colony of humans go for a trip to the nearest star to our sun alpha centauri (yes i did some research) and a alien AI Robot attack happens and they get stranded on a solar system unknown where they take refuge on a planet little and about there way to find a way back to civilization. 
            The second season start is disappointing as it made no sense at all and had too many plot points although many of them are solved by the end but still many were unresolved but further the season 2 has lot going for it particularly the all women they had an important role this season. 
            The CGI is on point and the worlds look gorgeous and the life that they have shown.They did a great job on the robot it looked stunning.The visuals of most of the planets and other nature shots will stun you as they are beautifully made.
            The first season ended on a cliff hanger and so does the second and  every episode i guess ended on a note that wants you to come back for more.This is why it becomes a good show as it constantly makes you come back for more. <b>~Ch Habib</b></li>

        <li>"I love sci-fi flics but not into space based series, shows, or movies. **BUT… this show is simply Amazing!!** It has almost
            every category you can want in any show. There's the sci-if, comedy, drama, violence, gore,(if there is such a thing as 
            “CLASSY GORE” this is it Hahaa;)~  Some shows have characters tht you can “see” some of your own self in from 
            decisions—emotions—& attitude. You really get to see the characters and story grow into such a wonderful show!
            Even if you don't like space,alien,spaceships&etc you should give this show a shot bc it's not yr “normal” space show it has
            so much more to offer. (Also If you like space shows you will guarantee love this show) Lost in space is great for family's, 
            children, teens, show bingers like me lol, or even as a date option is good too! LIS will pull heart strings, make you 
            angry(in a good way lol) question why this or tht happens, make you laugh, maybe cry, but it will definitely make you fall in
            love with all characters in this show for many different reasons it's amazing!;)))~ ) I would recommend this to friends and
            family most definitely!!;)):)) <b>~Alisha Parker</b></li>
